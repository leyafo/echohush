# EchoHush Help
Echo Hush is a journal app designed for capturing your daily experiences. You can write anything in it—every thought, feeling, or moment that matters to you. Your diary is stored securely with encryption, ensuring that no one else can access it. Your data remains private and protected.

Robert A. Heinlein once said:

“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.”

A person’s memories might include:

Swinging a wooden sword like a hero, slashing roadside grass as a child; dressing up Barbie dolls or commanding plastic soldiers in imaginary wars; secretly tossing out the healthy but unappealing meals your mom forced you to eat. The thrill of covering up a failed exam, the flush of excitement and racing heartbeat when catching sight of a crush, or the sweet exhaustion after a day spent with a lover. The rush of buying your first computer, the pride of earning your first paycheck. The sting of heartbreak, the bittersweet twinge when an ex gets married. The highs of making a fortune and the lows of losing one. Whatever the memory, Echo Hush lets you record it all, safeguarded by the strongest encryption on Earth. And when you want to look back, our full-text search—faster than your own memory—will retrieve those moments that are uniquely yours.

Below are some minor details about the app to help you quickly document life’s moments—even the chaotic ones, like a crime scene.
